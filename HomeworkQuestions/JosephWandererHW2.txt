Q1: What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

A1: True and False with a capital T and F, the rest lowercase and without quote marks.

Q2: What are the three Boolean operators?

A2: "and", "or" and "not".

Q3: Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator.

A3: 	"And"
	True and True = True
	True and False = False
	False and False = False

	"Or"
	True or True = True
	True or False = True
	False or False = False

	"not"
	not True = False
	not False = Ture

Q4: What do the following expressions evaluate to?

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

A4:
	False
	False
	True
	False
	False
	True

Q5: What are the six comparison operators?

A5: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=

Q6: What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?

A6: The equal to operator "==" compares two values to see if they are the same.
 The assignment operator "=" takes a value or expression and assigns it to a variable.

Q7: Explain what a condition is a where you would use one.

A7: A condition is an expression that determines subsequent actions depending on whether it evaluates to True or False.
You would use them in while loops and if statements to refine flow control and allow programs to change behavior according to circumstances.

Q8: Identify the three blocks in this code:

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
    print('eggs')
    if spam > 5:
        print('bacon')
    else:
        print('ham')
    print('spam')
print('spam')

A8: 
	1: the block starting with print('eggs'), containing the other two blocks and ending with print('spam').
	2: the block containing print('bacon').
	3: the block containing print('ham').

Q9: Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

A9: 
spam = input()
if spam == 1:
	print('Hello')
elif spam == 2:
	print('Howdy')
else:
	print('Greetings!')

Q10: What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop?

A10: Ctrl-C

Q11: What is the difference between break and continue?

A11: The break statement makes the program execution immediately exit the while loop in which it is found.
The continue statement returns the program execution to the top of the loop to immediately evaluate its condition again.

Q12: What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop?

A12: There is no functional difference between the three; the otherwise default arguments of the range function (start and step) are simply made explicit in the latter two.

Q13: Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 usng a for loop. Then write an equivalent program the prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

A13:

for i in range(10):
	print(i + 1)

count = 1
while count <= 10:
	print(count)
	count = count + 1

Q14: If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?

A14: spam.bacon()
