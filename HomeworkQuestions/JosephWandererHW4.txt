Q:1. What is []?
A1: An empty list.

Q:2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)
A:2.the statement: spam[2] = 'hello'

For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'].
 

Q:3. What does spam[int(int('3' * 2) // 11)] evaluate to?
A:3. spam[3] which is 'd'

Q:4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?
A:4. the last item on the list which is 'd'

Q:5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?
A:5. ['a','b']

For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True].


Q:6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
A:6. 1

Q:7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like?
A:7. [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

Q:8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
A:8. [3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

Q:9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication?
A:9. +, *

Q:10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods?
A:10. append() adds the argument to the end of a list while insert() can add the argument at any index in the list.

Q:11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?
A:11. the del statement and the remove() method.

Q:12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values.
A:12. Both can be used with indexing, slices, the len()function, for loops and then in and not in operators.

Q:13. What is the difference between lists and tuples?
A:13. lists are made with square brackets [] and are mutable whereas tuples use parentheses() and are immutable, ie. can't be modified with something like append()

Q:14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?
A:14. (42,)

Q:15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?
A:15. You can use the tuple() function on a list to get a tuple form of it. Or use the list() function on a tuple to get a list form of the tuple value.

Q:16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead?
A:16. List references that point to lists.

Q:17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
A:17. copy.copy() will create a duplicicate list rather than just a list reference. copy.deepcopy() will also duplicate the lists nested within a list.
